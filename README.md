# Tensormodels
A python package for Tensorflow. It has the right level of abstraction needed to built state-of-the-art deep learning models. Tensormodels also provides queues for data prefetching, so you don't have to use Tensorflow data queues and you can write custom augmentation functions. It also allows training on multi-gpus without any change in code.
